# Coffee Machine Program

This is a simple Python program simulating a coffee machine. Users can choose from different types of coffee, insert coins, and receive their coffee if the required resources are available.

## Menu

- **Espresso:**
  - Ingredients: Water (50 ml), Coffee (18 g)
  - Cost: $1.5

- **Latte:**
  - Ingredients: Water (200 ml), Milk (150 ml), Coffee (24 g)
  - Cost: $2.5

- **Cappuccino:**
  - Ingredients: Water (250 ml), Milk (100 ml), Coffee (24 g)
  - Cost: $3.0

## Resources

The coffee machine has the following initial resources:

- Water: 300 ml
- Milk: 200 ml
- Coffee: 100 g

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to choose a coffee type (espresso, latte, cappuccino).
3. Insert coins when prompted, and the program will calculate the total.
4. The program will either dispense the coffee or refund money based on the transaction result.

## Commands

- Type the name of the desired coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) to make a selection.
- Type "report" to view the current resources (water, milk, coffee).
- Type "off" to turn off the coffee machine.

## Note

- Ensure you have sufficient resources before making a coffee selection.
- The program calculates the cost, processes coins, and provides change if needed.
